## About This Projectd

### website for travel agency

- Used ReactJs to implement this project
- This is a single page application
- Here firebase is used for authentication
- Used Private Router
- context api
- for database I used MongoDB
- responsive design

NB: Having a issue with Firebase auth & server side db connection. But I tried to do as much as possible. I don't know why this time I am having this issue , previously it worked fine
